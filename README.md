Joseph (the Butler) an event driven, extensible home automation project with framework aspirations. 

## Features

In no particular order, these are Joseph's (planned) features

- Plugin loader and reloader
    - Watch folder for easy drop and play functionality
    - Extensible entity types
    - Ideally plugins would run in their own sandbox (Undecided)
- Event bus
- Rule evaluation
- REST API for easy communication with the outside world
- YAML based database structure

## Previous versions and author's note

I have started this project many times over already, mostly for the same reasons. Due to inexperience the project ended up cluttered which made it very difficult to implement everything I had envisioned. This time, I'll keep the core minimal and do all the "cool" things through plugins, keeping Joseph as light and easy to maintain as possible. 

## Disclaimer

While I'm very passionate about programming and Joseph in particular, I'm still fairly inexperienced, especially when it comes to big projects. This means that while everyone is free to use this software for their own projects, keep in mind that you do so on your own risk. See the included LICENSE for more information.
